        # get_context_data(). This causes get_context_data() to
        # construct a new form instance with the same data in order to

        # that form's ``errors`` or ``cleaned_data`` runs that form
        # instance's validation. The end result is that validation
        # gets run twice on an invalid form submission, which is
        # undesirable for performance reasons.
        #
